# Bots

## Purpose

The initial use case of this app is for parents to provide access to AI bots to their kids for tutoring or other educational/fun purposes safely and cheaply. 

Like https://www.khanmigo.ai/ this app will enable students to interact with AI to help them with their writing, math, and any other subject. Unlike Khanmigo, this app will cost less than $4 a month and enable parents to completely customize the bots to their specific needs.
