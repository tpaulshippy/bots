# Syft Learning

## Purpose

This app is for parents to provide access to AI bots to their kids for tutoring or other educational/fun purposes safely and cheaply.

Like https://www.khanmigo.ai/ this app will enable students to interact with AI to help them with their writing, math, and any other subject. Unlike Khanmigo, this app will cost less than $4 a month and enable parents to completely customize the bots to their specific needs.
